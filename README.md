# Wokio, the "game of pwning libtards".
This is a parody of Super Mario Bros, following a very particular and very real stereotype: the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, traditionalist, etc white male.
Instead of lives, you have a Based-O-Meter that turns red when you're doing well and blue when you're not. Various achievements increase the Based-O-Meter, and various
forms of damage decrease it. Instead of mushrooms and fire flowers, you get Red Pills that enable some special attacks; coins increase the Based-O-Meter.

Other than that, it's mostly the same as super mario.

**CONTENT WARNING**: This game centers around mocking a certain set of ideologies. This means there is racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, and other forms of bigotry
presented, albeit in a humorous light. There's also foul language and sexually suggestive material; this game is probably Not Safe For Work.

Made in jest, keep smiling.
